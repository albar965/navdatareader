===============================================================================

# Version 1.2.3

* Addedd support for MSFS 2024. Now loading airports using SimConnect #1198
* Added new SimConnect options to configuration files. #1198
* Added option to drop temporary tables.
* Option to load disconnected navaids for MSFS 2024 from file.
* Adapted detection of Navigraph update to new folder names and made it more tolerant. #1198
* Fixed issues where airways were not built correctly reading X-Plane data.
  Examples which did not read:
  `ZBAA IDKEX B339 ASILA A575 INTIK Y655 AROGU A575 KD A308 ML A300 RUBOR T448 SOPUS USSS`,
  `ZUCK PINAB W80 WFX W179 OMBON B330 GOBIN W66 NUKTI B215 HAM W99 AGOXA ZWWW` and
  `ZUCK UNRIX W180 BONSA W91 IDSID W30 MEBNA ZPPP` #1219
* Fixed issue when building airways from X-Plane navdata. Example: The wrong NDB BM/UH far
  away was selected to build the airway A800. #1237

===============================================================================
# Version 1.2.1

## DFD

* Better airspace display deometry for Navigraph database. Now considering Rhumb line segment
  flag in airspace description. This eliminates wrong airspace boundaries drawn as
  Great Circle lines.

## MSFS, P3D and FSX

* Fixed issue where detection of malformed MSFS airports rejected valid airport add-ons with a
  message `Duplicate airport ident`. This happened when add-on developers put more than one of the
  same airport into one BGL file.

## X-Plane

* Fixed wrong airport bounding rectangle calculation for X-Plane airports. Example: KSEA in
  X-Plane 12. This resulted in a too far zoom out when double clicking the airport.
* Fixed duplicate reading of X-Plane `airspace.txt`. The file `airspace.txt` in `Custom Data` now
  overrides the one in `Resources`.
* Fixed issues reading MSA centers where runways were not detected. Now also looking for center
  points of ILS.

## All Compilers

* Cleanup in navdatabase compiler. Tables `airport_medium`, `airport_large`, `route_node_radio`,
  `route_edge_radio`, `route_node_airway` and `route_edge_airway` now removed. This breaks
  compatibility with versions before 2020 of *Little Navmap*. The program will show an SQL exception
  if this is the case. Users have to update *Little Navmap* if they run into this.
* Added waypoint names to X-Plane and DFD compilers. albar965/littlenavmap#1176
* Better detection of the longest runway for airports. Now ignoring water runways if airport has
  water and land runways.
* View creation in database now disabled.
* Updated minor database version to 29 due to several schema changes. This results in a notice
  about a previous database version although reloading is not required. albar965/littlenavmap#1176
* Better airspace geometry for all airspaces read from simulator and user libraries. Note that a
  workaround is used to detect these segments for simulator and user airspaces since required
  information is missing in simulators.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.2.0

## DFD

* Fixed issue where circular airspace arcs resulted in self crossing polygons. The fix is
  required for airspace text placement in Little Navmap 3.0 and later.
* Runways marked as closed are now shown as such.
* Airport patterns now correctly marked as not available.
* Runways having one end closed are now positioned correctly. Example: EDDF runway 18.

## MSFS, P3D and FSX

* Fixed issues with moved or updated airports when reading scenery library.
* Now excluding all navaids in detected Navigraph update when reading the scenery library.
* Fixed wrong calculation for airport rating which did not update add-on airports.
* MSFS: Wrongly built airports like the MS MKJS now keep their procedure information in MSFS despite
  trying to override it with an empty procedure set. #1085

## X-Plane

* Now setting "is_draw_surface" always to 1 for X-Plane to avoid transparent aprons.
  albar965/littlenavmap#1059

## All Compilers

* Doubled number of pre-calculated arc and circle segments for more accuracy in map display
  airspaces.
* Additional scenery folder is now read recursively for all simulators.
* Deleting duplicate navaids now by region, ident and position. This allows to update frequency or
  type for VOR and NDB on P3D or FSX by add-on.


===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.31

## DFD

* Now adding start positions for runways and parking spots to allow departure parking selection.

## X-Plane

* X-Plane 12 manually corrected localizers file is now read.

## MSFS

* Fix for missing aircraft model translations since MSFS SU12.
* Fixed country names appearing as language keys when compiling MSFS. Names are now empty again
  since MSFS does not provide these.
* Corrected detection and reading of Navigraph navdata update in MSFS. Now reading airports from
  update. Navdata and procedures are ignored. The wrongly excluded package is now read. Speed up for
  reading scenery library by ignoring unused procedures from navdata update. #1019
* Fixed issue where MSFS navdata update was recognized despite having its folders excluded.
* More cleanup for MSFS airport names. Now removing space at end and beginning of all names to
  allow search since some airport names are entered wrongly.
* Corrected overzealous filter for MSFS airport dummy structures which removed add-on helipads or
  airports. Example add-on: `willicopta-spital-la-chaux-de-fonds-lsh9` which did not show up.

## Prepar3D

* Added support for Prepar3D v6.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.30

## All

* Fixed issue with mapped drives on Windows where add-on airports were not detected when having
  MSFS installed on a mapped drive.
* Now supporting symbolic links, Windows junctions and Windows shortcuts in MSFS `Community` and
  X-Plane `Custom Scenery` folder. Fixed exclude file, exclude directory and exclude add-on
  recognition to consider links.
* Fixed issue where paths were stored with the wrong separators in the database on Windows.
* Now using canonical path to compare scenery library exclusions set from the user interface to
  avoid issues with symbolic links.
* Minor version of database changed to 27 to indicate change in metadata table and parking suffix
  change.
* Windows build is now 64-bit.
* Added option to disable obsolete airport_large and airport_medium tables.

## DFD

* Now populating column ils.loc_width and calculating geometry accordingly. #1011
* Adjusted validation limits for VOR and NDB.

## X-Plane

* Fixed several issues with new X-Plane runway surface types. Fixed dropped runways if they used
  unknown surface types for X-Plane airports. This resulted in airports registered without runways
  and having helipad symbol assigned. Implemented new undocumented asphalt and concrete textures
  found in WED 2.5.
* Removing area/country codes from X-Plane country names now.
* Calculating RNP value now correct for procedures from X-Plane data.
* Fixed remaining issues with macOS aliases. These can now be used in X- Plane `Custom Scenery`.
* Made reading of X-Plane `scenery_packs.ini` more error tolerant for XP12. Now only printing warnings.
* Fixed import and export for X-Plane 11 and 12 `user_fix.dat`. Now allowing null coordinates as well
  exporting and importing waypoint flags and full name. Userpoint tags are used to load and save the
  ID of the airport terminal area and the waypoint type.
* Fixed issue where X-Plane 12 add-on airports were not read from `Custom Scenery`. Airports not
  included in the file `scenery_packs.ini` are now treated like enabled. #927
* Fixed error message when reading XP12 scenery packs file.
* Now falling back to Asphalt for undocumented, unknown or invalid surface types in XP12.

## MSFS

* Adjusted detection of Navigraph package.
* Corrected layer ordering for MSFS scenery library to adhere to priorities in file `Content.xml`.
* Fixed issue where airport city names were missing since MSFS SU11 beta.
* Changed handling for MSFS file `Content.xml` for SU10. Priorities for known base folders are now
  forced to lowest values to ensure the correct loading order. Other folders are loaded without any
  special order.
* Now ignoring waypoints with empty ICAO region code and invalid type as they appear in some MSFS
  add-on sceneries. #910
* Reduced logging for invalid MSFS BGL files.
* Now allowing BGL files from missions to catch respective airports for MSFS.
* Added general properties column to the database metadata table. Now storing in properties if
  navdata update was found for MSFS to allow later database validation.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.29

## All

* Minor database version updated to 27 for schema changes.
* Added columns `has_vertical_angle` and `has_rnp` to table `approach`.
* Now renaming output database and adding suffix `BROKEN` to avoid accidental use in case of error.

## X-Plane and DFD

* Added airport transition level for X-Plane and DFD compiler.
* Corrected issues with true course runways like in BGTL for X-Plane and DFD compiler. Approaches
  were missing runway assignments and could not be resolved. #870
* Fixed issues with magnetic variation and inbound course in DFD and X-Plane compiler.
* Holding course is now written as magnetic course to avoid unneeded calculations. This also fixes
  the wrong en-route holding inbound course in Little Navmap.

## X-Plane

* Fixed issue `Index out of bounds: Index: 5, size: 5` when reading X-Plane user_fix.dat with
  optional column missing.
* Now skipping empty X-Plane `apt.dat` files to avoid program freezing in an empty loop for
  malformed files.
* Fixed exception while loading X-Plane scenery library if files `earth_hold.dat`, `earth_mora.dat` or
  `earth_msa.dat` cannot be found in `Custom Data` despite existing fix, nav and airway files.
* Prepared data compilation for X-Plane 12 based on limited information. Added X-Plane 12
  detection. #867
* Fixed database connection leak when compiling X-Plane scenery library.
* Improved transition level and altitude reading for X-Plane since users add various variants.

## MSFS

* Corrected closed airport logic for MSFS. Now fully relying on closed airport flag for MSFS. This
  can result in closed airports having open runways and open airports having all runways open. #876
* Changed handling for MSFS file `Content.xml` for SU10. Priorities for known base folders are now
  forced to lowest values to ensure the correct loading order. Other folders are loaded without any
  special order.
* Now ignoring waypoints with empty ICAO region code and invalid type as they appear in some MSFS
  add-on sceneries. This fixes the exception `NOT NULL constraint failed: tmp_waypoint.region ...`
  when loading. #910
* Now allowing BGL files from missions to catch respective airports for MSFS.
* Community path for MSFS is now optional for detection but will throw an error on loading if missing.
* Added suffix to airport parking.
* Added push request #16 of @flpduarte. Fixed bug in which Little Navmap would only read and
  display a single transition from addon (Community) SIDs and STARs, despite these procedures
  actually having more than one transition. This happens when using the latest MSFS SDK (SU9 or later).
* Added warning messages for encrypted MSFS add-ons when reading scenery library.
* Fixed issue where airport frequencies were written as 0 instead of null for MSFS resulting in
  wrong search results.
* Fixed issue where all airports were recognized as add-on with MSFS update 9.
* Fixed issues for updating airports by disabling a corner case from FSX and P3D which apparently
  does not apply to MSFS. Before a feature was not updated if the new airport did not contain new
  features like aprons or taxiways. Example LICC add-on.
* Reduced logging for invalid MSFS BGL files.

## Build

* Moved version number to variable in file `navdatareader.pro` instead of coding into
  sources. Now writing files `version.txt` and `revision.txt` files into deployment folder allowing
  deployment scripts to automatically name archives.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.28

* Navdatareader now exits with failure if basic validation fails.
* Added aircraft category to approach table filled by DFD compiler.
* Added Required Navigation Performance (RNP) field to approach_legs and transition_legs to DFD and
  X-Plane compiler.
* Added compilation of path points to DFD compiler.
* Incremented database version to 23.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.27

* Adapted validation to new row numbers for DFD in cycle 2201. This fixes the `idx_boundary_file_id
  already exists` issue.
* Removed exception in table validation. Now only printing a warning if table count does not match.
  This ensures a complete database even if validation finds issues.
* Now keeping indexes when finishing DFD database. This avoids the `preparing database` message in
  Little Navmap when loading the database the first time.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.26

## New Features in Database

Airport MSA sectors, enroute holdings, vertical angles in procedures and SBAS/GBAS/RNP/GLS information.

## Notes for Little Navmap versions smaller or equal to 2.6.17

* Additions and fixes should not cause issues and will be fully used in future Little Navmap
  development releases 2.7 as well as stable releases of 2.8.
* GLS paths might incorrctly show up as ILS feathers  but only when using the `Navigraph for all
  Features` scenery selection on DFD compiled databases.
* Airport parking positions can be selected when using `Navigraph for all Features` but are not
  shown on the map.

## All

* Updated database minor version to 22. Database version is now 14.22.
* Changed execution order to allow content checking of table `scripts` in database compiler.

* Added gate positions to DFD compiler now used in table `parking`.
* Added writing of airport MSA sectors and pre-calculated geometry to DFD and X-Plane compiler.
  Table `airport_msa`. albar965/littlenavmap#498
* Added SBAS/GBAS paths points and stations to X-Plane and DFD databases. Added to table `ils`.
* Added vertical angle to approach and transition legs now read from DFD, X-Plane and MSFS. Column
  `vertical_angle` in tables `approach_leg` and table `transition_leg`. albar965/littlenavmap#803
* Added column `arinc_type` for detailed waypoint information to tables `waypoint` and
  `nav_search`. Populating arinc_type for X-Plane and DFD database compilers.
* Fixed issue where theta and rho in procedures were written as 0 instead of null values in DFD and
  X-Plane compiler. This did not allow to recognize the difference between bearing 0 and bearing not given.
* Fixed issue in DFD compiler where runways with offset threshold were not depicted properly.
* Corrected assignment of runway end ids to ILS in DFD compiler.
* Fixing equal runway end positions for DFD compiler now which resulted in zero-length runways when
  drawing.

  new MSFS record. Disabled warning about unknown airport record types when compiling MSFS data.
  albar965/littlenavmap#799
* Corrected MSFS dummy POI airport detection. Now ignoring airport closed flag.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.25

* Excluding Navigraph manifest file now to avoid error messages with package "navigraph-maintenance"
  when reading MSFS scenery data.
* Limited localizer width to 20 degree to avoid excessive values from FSX and MSFS breaking ILS geometry.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.21.beta

## Related notes from atools Version 3.6.3.beta and 3.6.4.beta

* Fixed issue with missing longest runway surface for airports with MSFS.
* Now imitating the behavior of MSFS if an scenery update tries to reuse the ident of an airport
  for a new one. Example: Boyd Field (54XS) in MSFS which actually Bar C Ranch Airport (54XS) in
  real life at another location.
* Fixed issue where military airports were not recognized in add-ons.
* Adjusted detection of MSFS Navigraph navdata update to avoid all airports being detected as add-on.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.20.beta

## Related notes from atools Version 3.6.2.beta

* Fixed issue where program could appear frozen while counting files for loading scenery.
* Fixed detection for military airports in MSFS and extended this with new phrases.
* Now capitalizing all airport names for FSX, P3D and MSFS to fix wrong airbase designators
  like  `Afb`.
* Fixed issue with NOAA weather downloads where a missing internet connection flooded the log and
  caused the program to crash. Now applying a grace period of three minutes after an error which
  blocks new downloads for METAR requests.
* Removed wrong rounding of COM frequencies.
* Now checking for all paths `Community`, `fs-base` and `fs-base-nav` before recognizing a MSFS
  installation as valid.
* `asobo-airports-*` in `Official\Steam` or `Official\OneStore` are now flagged as add-on.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.19.beta

Related notes from atools Version 3.6.1.beta

MSFS:

* Fixed issue with `NOT NULL constraint failed:tmp_waypoint.ident Unable to fetch...`.
  Navids with empty names are now ignored and printed into the log with BGL file name.
* Changed default MSFS Steam flight plan path to base folder `Microsoft Flight Simulator`.
* Localizer heading for MSFS now saved correctly in scenery database.
* Also looking in `OneStore` and `Steam` folder for add-ons now.
* Updating administrative names in airports now if missing in update. This also corrects missing
  names for the Navigraph navdata update.
* Adapted to Navigraph navdata update 12 for MSFS.
  Updating only needed features which are airports, COM and ILS. Everything else is ignored and not
  needed since it can be updated directly for Little Navmap.
* Corrected ILS course for Navigraph update in simulator. Slight variations like for EDDM remain.

Other:

* Airports with empty names now raise an exception which will show an error dialog to the user.
* Removed unneeded indexes from tables `nav_search` and `taxi_path` to shrink database.
* Updated to world magnetic model 2020. This will be used to calculate X-Plane declination when
  loading the scenery database.
* Fixed issue where declination was not created correctly for locale which do not have a . as
  decimal separator. This is due to functions in WMM code. As a result of the issue declination was
  20 degrees off near VORDME STN in X-Plane, for example. #564
* Removed unused delete_airport table to speed up loading and to keep database small.
* Now capitalizing airport, city, state and country names when loading FSX, P3D or MSFS data.

Related notes from atools Version 3.6.0.beta

Scenery Database:

* Full MSFS scenery library support with simulator detection.
* Progress for scenery database loading with FSX/P3D, X-Plane and DFD reworked to avoid
  under- or overflow and to have a more balanced progress rate.
* Fixed issues with user home folders containing special characters. This caused various
  issues when detecting flight simulators.
* Added more invalid taxiway names like `_` to avoid in X-Plane.


Other, technical, internal or development related:

* Updated file roller to allow usage of file rename patterns.
* Updated logging for separate debug message and narrow patterns which remove namespaces from class
  and paths from filenames for better readability.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.18

All changes from atools version 3.4.7.
Mostly fixes for DFD and other data compilers.

All data compilers and schema changes:
* Updated database minor version to 18 to reflect changes.
* Fixed issue with duplicate waypoints in airways for DFD, X-Plane and FSX/P3D compiler causing
  defects in airway network. Examples: MY/EK and SYA/PA. #516
* Added flag "artificial" for NDB and VOR waypoints which are created to simplify
  airway construction. Useful for debugging or future versions. #516

DFD:
* Updated DFD compiler to create new and separate UIR FIR airspace types besides the old
  deprecated center with "(FIR)" or "(UIR)" in the name. These new types will be used by the next
  Little Navmap version. Current versions 2.4.X are compatible with this change and show
  the old centers. #462
* Fixed issue where runway ends with more than one ILS had all except one detached from runway.
  Example: EDDF RWY25R ILSZ IFNW. #532
* Coordinates for fix and recommended fix in procedure tables added. Used for better navaid
  resolution in next Little Navmap version. #205
* Adding artificial waypoints to allow procedure fix resolution in LNM versions <= 2.4.5 in DFD databases.

X-Plane:
* Improved removal of "[X]" prefixes in X-Plane and fixed issue where military airports were not
  detected in all cases.
* Changed airport ident to ICAO code for X-Plane compiler now. XP internal ids are now avoided
  except in duplicates. Added xpident to airport table which keeps the internal ID for
  X-Plane airports. #448
* Added runway smoothness and airport flatten flags from X-Plane to database schema.
* Corrected navaid range calculation for X-Plane. 125 NM is now treated as unpublished.

P3D:
* Fixed issue with P3D v5 not loading tower, unicom and other frequencies for all airports.
  As a result all airports are shown in magenta color.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.17

from atools version 3.0.0.beta
DFD/X-Plane:
* Fixed issue where approach name and/or suffix were not read correctly in X-Plane and DFD compiler.

* Now ignoring artificial circle-to-land approaches in DFD compiler.
FSX/P3D:
* Added script by Gérard to clean out fake runways for AI in FSX/P3D.
* Added logging for airport altitude when reading delete records from FSX/P3D.
  Example: "Add-on airport altitude for VQ10 changed from 7703 ft (BGL Scenery/0902/APX72220.bgl) to 8363 ft"
* Improved BGL file and scenery reading to include hidden and system files.

Version 1.0.9

from atools version 2.8.7
* Now updating magnetic declination for VOR with calculated value where missing.

Version 1.0.8

from atools version 2.8.6
* Custom Scenery/Global Airports/Earth nav data/earth_nav.dat is now read to get fixed ILS for X-Plane. #209
* Fixed reading of ILS for non consecutive entries in X-Plane dat file. #209
* Corrected wrong runway heading from DFD compilation. #214
* SID and STAR common routes are now merged correctly into procedures for DFD and X-Plane compiler. #193
* Airport idents from DFD compilation are now all converted to original three-letter code if available. #203
* Added new columns runway_end.altitude, approach_leg.approach_fix_type and transition_leg.approach_fix_type
  for future use.
* Updated database minor version to 9.

Version 1.0.7

* Updated from Qt 5.9.1 to 5.9.3
* Now removing any stale output databases to avoid accidental file merge.

from atools version 2.8.5
* Fixed errors when compiling the X-Plane database with PRDAT records in CIFP files since AIRAC 1801. albar965/littlenavmap#202
* Fixes for missing airway segments in DFD compiler.
* Fixed overly eager de-duplication of waypoints. albar965/littlenavmap#201

Version 1.0.6

Although adapted to small schema changes Little Navmap is still compatible with old databases.

from atools version 2.8.4
* Column "arinc_name" in table "approaches" is now filled with TRANS_IDENT for SID and STAR to get runway
  information for multiple or all. Needed for future fixes of albar965/littlenavmap#179.
* Added new columns "region" and "is_3d" (X-Plane) in airport table. Adapted all compilers to fill these.
* Database minor version bumped up to 8 which is an indication for schema changes but still compatible.
* Number of ALS is now correctly assigned to airports in X-Plane data compiler.
  This resulted in many airports having an ALS indication where none is.

Version 1.0.5

* No changes except version.

1.0.4.beta

* Adjusted basic validation for new results after fixes in atools.

from atools version 2.8.2.beta

* DFD compiler now estimates if holding is given in time or distance for procedure legs.
* DFD compiler now always sets region for fixes where it was missing for procedure legs.
* Solved problem where fix was not set for DME distance and radial terminated procedure legs.
  Now copying recommended fix to avoid invalid procedures.

1.0.3.beta

* Calculating range from NDB navaid_class now.
* Basic validation values are now more precise for DFD compilation.
* Fixed logging configuration to produce separate error and warning log now.
* DFD compiler now estimates if holding is given in time or distance for procedure legs.
* DFD compiler now always sets region for fixes where it was missing for procedure legs.
* Solved problem where fix was not set for DME distance and radial terminated procedure legs. Now copying recommended fix.

1.0.2.beta

* Updated manual re. error reporting and compilation failure.
* Program now fails on all kind of errors with return code 1.

from atools version  2.8.0.beta
* Fixed crash when getting simulator base path for unknown simulator type.

1.0.1.beta

* All indexes are dropped after compilation now to save download bandwidth.
  Indexes are created again by Little Navmap on first database usage on the client's side.
* Small fixes in logging where messages went to stderr where they shouldn't.
* Added DropAllIndexes option in configuration file.
* Extended database metadata with optional compiler_version, valid_through and data source columns.
* Increased database minor version to 6.

from atools version 2.8.0.beta

* Finished DFD to Little Navmap database compiler for Navigraph data. #126
* Added script table and option to store create index scripts in that table for preparation by the client. #126
* Added option to drop indexes after database creation to keep the file small.
* Vacuum and analyze option for database creation now defaults to true to get smaller and better organized files. #126
* Fixed error with wrong ILS pitch in X-Plane compiler.
* Disabling maximum airway segment length now for data sources that contain a valid airspace geometry
  (X-Plane and DFD - FSX/P3D contain invalid segments).
* Fixed several problems with bounding box and overlap calculations around the anti meridian.
* Better handling of X-Plane OpenAirspace comments and fixed problem where airspace names contain a comment character.

1.0.0.beta

* Updated database metadata.
* Fixes for bounding box calculation around the anti meridian.

changes from atools 2.7.0.develop:
* Finished DFD compiler
